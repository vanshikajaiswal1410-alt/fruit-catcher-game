🍎 Fruit Catcher Game (Flutter)

This is a simple Flutter-based arcade game where players catch falling fruits using a basket.

The basket is controlled by horizontal swipe gestures.

Each caught fruit increases the score, while missed fruits reduce lives.

The game ends when all lives are lost and shows the final score.

Random fruit generation makes the gameplay dynamic and engaging.
